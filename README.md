## Idea

Traffic Jam is a VR game where you stand in the middle of a busy intersection. Using only your hands and/or voice to control cars and stop traffic jams. Your job is to avoid crashes and keep things moving.

**Why is it a good idea?**

- The game is simple and different.
- Anyone can play without using buttons or controllers.

## Features

**Core features:** 

- Detect simple gestures like "stop", and "go" using VR hand tracking (open palm to stop, pointing and wave to move) and voice recognition like "stop", and "go".
- Traffic AI System
Vehicles must approach from four directions and respond to player gestures (stop or move forward).
- Collision System
If the player makes mistakes, cars will crash or block the road.
- Feedback System
The game gives signs when traffic is bad. like car horns, flashing lights, or angry cars.
- etc

**Stretch goals:** 

- Different Vehicle Types
Add trucks, buses, bikes, or emergency vehicles that need special handling.
- Angry Driver Reactions
If cars wait too long, a cartoon-style face balloon appears above them (ðŸ˜ , ðŸ˜¤, ðŸ¤¯) to show theyâ€™re getting mad. This helps the player know where to focus.
- etc
